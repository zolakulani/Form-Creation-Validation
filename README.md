Deep Dive into JavaScript
This repository contains the solutions for the "Deep Dive into JavaScript" project, focusing on enhancing understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous JavaScript. The project involves developing a user registration form, an interactive quiz, a simple calculator, and an application to fetch and display data from a public API.

üìö Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn how to:

Implement Form Validation: Understand and implement basic form validation using JavaScript to ensure user inputs meet specified criteria.

Work with the DOM: Utilize DOM manipulation to dynamically interact with HTML elements and leverage event listeners for user interactions.

Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs: Fetch and display data asynchronously from public APIs, and handle potential errors during data fetching.

Enhance User Experience: Provide real-time feedback to users for form validation and ensure data persistence across browser sessions using local storage.

üìã Tasks Overview
This project is divided into four mandatory tasks:

0. Form Creation and Validation
Repository: Form-Creation-Validation

Files: index.html, style.css, script.js

Description: Implement client-side validation for a user registration form. The JavaScript (script.js) will validate inputs for username (minimum 3 characters), email (must contain '@' and '.'), and password (minimum 8 characters) upon form submission. Feedback will be displayed in real-time.

1. Implement a Simple Interactive Quiz
Repository: ALX_Simple_Quiz

Files: index.html, styles.css, quiz.js

Description: Create a basic interactive quiz. The checkAnswer JavaScript function (quiz.js) will determine if the user's selected answer is correct and update a feedback message accordingly. An event listener on the "Submit Answer" button will trigger this function.

2. Build a Simple Calculator
Repository: ALX_Simple_Quiz

Files: calculator.html, calculator.css, calculator.js

Description: Develop a functional web-based calculator. The JavaScript (calculator.js) will implement separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Event listeners for each operation button will perform calculations on user inputs and display the result.

3. Fetching Data from an API and Displaying It
Repository: Form-Creation-Validation

Files: fetch-data.html, fetch-data.css, fetch-data.js

Description: Fetch user data asynchronously from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. The fetchUserData function (fetch-data.js) will retrieve user names and display them as an unordered list on the webpage, including error handling.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling the applications and ensuring responsiveness.

JavaScript (ES6+): For implementing interactive functionality, form validation, API calls, and DOM manipulation.

üöÄ Setup and Usage
To run these projects locally:

Clone the repositories:

git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Form-Creation-Validation.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Form-Creation-Validation.git)
git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/ALX_Simple_Quiz.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/ALX_Simple_Quiz.git)

(Note: Replace YourGitHubUsername with your actual GitHub username.)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Form-Creation-Validation
# or
cd ALX_Simple_Quiz

Open the HTML files: Simply open index.html (for Form Validation and Quiz) or calculator.html/fetch-data.html in your web browser. The JavaScript will run automatically.
